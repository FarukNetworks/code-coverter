# Header Component Migration

## Overview
The header component in Angular is essential for navigation and style. Migrating to React involves modernizing with CSS-in-JS for styling efficiency and React Router for navigation.

## Migration Strategies
- **CSS-in-JS**: Utilize libraries like styled-components for encapsulated styles directly within React components.
- **React Router**: Adopt React Router to manage navigation efficiently, replacing Angular's routing strategies.

## Potential Challenges
- **Adaptive Styling**: Moving from Angular's CSS approach to component-centric styling can be nontrivial but provides greater flexibility.
- **Navigation Transition**: Properly configuring and ensuring the React Router replaces Angular routing correctly in the header.

## Architectural Changes
- Reinforce modular design with CSS-in-JS for responsive interfaces.
