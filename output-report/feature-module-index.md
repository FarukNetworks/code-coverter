# Feature Module Migration

## Overview
Angular's feature modules encapsulate functionality, which in React needs conversion to lazy-loaded components with shared data handled through React Context.

## Migration Strategies
- **Lazy Loading**: Use `React.lazy()` for ensuring components are loaded only when necessary, benefiting from optimized performance.
- **Shared State with Context**: Replace Angular's dependency system with React Context for efficient data sharing across components.

## Potential Challenges
- **Module to Component Transition**: Balancing component modularity without losing the integrated functionality offered by Angular's feature modules.
- **Data Management Shift**: Efficiently achieving a similar level of centralized data access using React's decentralized context system.

## Architectural Changes
- Move towards a component-centric architecture, leveraging React's design flexibility.
