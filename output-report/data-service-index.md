# Data Service Migration

## Overview
Angular's data services, typically built around RxJS, require a shift towards modern JavaScript techniques when migrating to React, most notably using async/await for managing async calls.

## Migration Strategies
- **Async/Await**: Simplifies asynchronous operations by adopting async/await syntax instead of observables.
- **Custom Data Hooks**: Create reusable hooks for data fetching to standardize HTTP request handling.

## Potential Challenges
- **Promises vs. Observables**: Adapting from RxJS's reactive programming model to promise-based handling.
- **Error Handling**: Leveraging React's error boundaries to handle exceptions over Angular's service error interception.

## Architectural Changes
- Centralize data logic within custom hooks and leverage useContext for better state handling.
