# Routing Migration Guide

## Overview

This guide summarizes the process for migrating Angular's routing system to a React-compatible routing framework, like React Router. Routing is key to any SPA (Single Page Application), and Angular's approach differs significantly from React's.

### Angular Routing

- Angular's routing is configured declaratively in modules, using paths and components.
- Discuss the role of the `RouterModule` and its configuration in Angular apps.

### React Migration Steps

- Introduction to React Router as a declarative routing solution for React.
- Guidance on converting Angular route configurations to React Router's `<Route>` components.

### Challenges and Solutions

- Explore common challenges, such as dynamic routing and lazy loading of components, and how to address them in React.

### High-Level Architectural Changes

- Outline the shift from Angular's module-based routing to using a routing library in the component-based architecture of React.
