# Dashboard Component Migration Plan

## Purpose and Functionality

The Dashboard component serves as the central hub for user interactions and data display within the application. It's responsible for rendering key application metrics and providing users with a summary of available information.

## Angular to React Migration

### Step 1: Analyze Component Structure
Identify all Inputs, Outputs, and lifecycle hooks used within the Angular Dashboard component. Convert Inputs and Outputs to React props and state management respectively.

### Step 2: Create Functional Component
Convert the Angular component into a React functional component, utilizing the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to replicate lifecycle behaviors.

### Step 3: Incorporate Styles
Adapt the SCSS styles to be used within the React component, either by direct inclusion or using a CSS-in-JS solution like styled-components.

### Step 4: Dependencies and Context
For any services or dependencies used, create custom hooks or contexts in React to provide the necessary data or functionality.

### Step 5: Finalizing the Component
Ensure the component is properly integrated into the React application, with state and props correctly managed and lifecycle methods thoroughly tested.

This migration plan outlines the primary steps for transforming the Angular Dashboard component into a React equivalent, focusing on functional components, hooks, and effective state management.
