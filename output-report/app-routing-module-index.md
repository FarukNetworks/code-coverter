# App Routing Module Migration

## Overview
Angular's routing facilitates navigation and modularization through lazy loading, which in React is managed differently using React Router and React's built-in lazy and suspense features.

## Migration Strategies
- **React Router**: Leverage React Router for route setup and navigation replacement.
- **Suspense and Lazy Loading**: React's Suspense and lazy mechanisms replace Angular's module lazy loading, loading components asynchronously as needed.

## Potential Challenges
- **Route Configuration Alignment**: Ensuring Angular routes are accurately translated into React Router paths.
- **Lazy Load Paradigm Shift**: Adapting from module-based loading to component-level code splitting in React.

## Architectural Changes
- Replace Angular's routing module system with React Router's declarative and component-based route management.
