# App Component Migration

## Overview
The Angular app component serves as the root with complex lifecycle needs and inter-component communication. React migration entails refactoring these using hooks and props.

## Migration Strategies
- **React Hooks**: Utilize hooks like `useEffect` and `useState` to mimic Angular lifecycle behavior.
- **Data Manipulation via Props**: Shift to using props for data transfer, removing Angular-specific bindings.

## Potential Challenges
- **Lifecycle Parity**: Correctly matching Angular lifecycle methods with corresponding hooks is crucial to transition smoothly.
- **Unidirectional Data**: Implementing data transfer using React's prop system requires architectural refactoring.

## Architectural Changes
- Embrace React's unidirectional flow for component interactions.
