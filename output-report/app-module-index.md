# App Module Migration

## Overview
The app module in Angular is responsible for bootstrapping and dependency management using NgModules. The migration to React focuses on replacing these constructs with more modular approaches using React's Context API and ES6 modules.

## Migration Strategies
- **React Context API**: Handle global states and dependencies by replacing Angular's NgModule system.
- **ES6 Modular System**: Utilize ES6 modules to organize React components and utilities, promoting reusable code.

## Potential Challenges
- **State Management**: Transitioning complex states from Angular's services to React's context requires strategic planning around `useContext` and hooks.
- **Bootstrap Process**: Familiarize with React's initialization process, potentially using Create React App or custom setups for more flexibility.

## Architectural Changes
- Replace hierarchical DI with React's more decentralized context management.
