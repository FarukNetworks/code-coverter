# Feature Module

## Purpose and Role
The feature module encapsulates a distinct feature or section of the Angular application, enhancing modularity and lazy loading capabilities.

## Migration Steps and React Equivalents
- **CommonModule**: No direct equivalent; React's modular system inherently covers this via component imports.
- **Lazy Loading**: Utilize React's `Suspense` and `lazy` for code-splitting and lazy-loaded components.

## Detailed Transformation Plans
1. Break down modules into individual React components and contexts.
2. Implement lazy-loaded components using `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for better performance and modularity.
3. Use React's context API for sharing common data/constants within the feature scope.
