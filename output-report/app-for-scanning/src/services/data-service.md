# Data Service

## Purpose and Role
The data service is responsible for data retrieval and operations, often managing HTTP requests to a backend.

## Migration Steps and React Equivalents
- **HttpClient**: Use `fetch` or libraries like `axios` in React for HTTP operations.
- **RxJS Operators**: Substitute RxJS operators with Promises or async/await syntax in JavaScript.

## Detailed Transformation Plans
1. Implement data fetching within components using hooks like `useEffect` or via context to provide data across components.
2. Replace Observable patterns with async functions using `await` for asynchronous operations.
