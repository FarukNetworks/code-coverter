# Header Component

## Purpose and Role
The header component is responsible for managing the header UI, including logo, navigation links, and other top-bar elements.

## Migration Steps and React Equivalents
- **Responsive Design**: Utilize CSS-in-JS libraries like `styled-components` or `emotion`.
- **Navigation Links**: Use `react-router-dom`'s `<Link>` components for navigation.

## Detailed Transformation Plans
1. Create a functional component in React for the header.
2. Use CSS frameworks or libraries to ensure responsive design.
3. Replace Angular template links with `<Link>` components from `react-router-dom`.
