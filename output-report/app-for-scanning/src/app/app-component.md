# App Component

## Purpose and Role
The app component acts as the root component in the Angular application, rendering the primary layout and housing other components.

## Migration Steps and React Equivalents
- **Lifecycle Hooks**: Translate Angular lifecycle hooks (e.g., ngOnInit) to React hooks (e.g., useEffect).
- **Bindings**: Convert Angular bindings to React's `props` and `state`.

## Detailed Transformation Plans
1. Implement a functional component in React.
2. Use `useEffect` for lifecycle-related tasks.
3. Pass down properties using `props` from the parent component.
