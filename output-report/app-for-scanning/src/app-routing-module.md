# App Routing Module

## Purpose and Role
The routing module manages the routing configuration of the Angular application, defining paths and associated components.

## Migration Steps and React Equivalents
- **Route Definitions**: Use `react-router-dom`'s `<Route>` components for defining routes.
- **Lazy Loading**: Implement route-based code splitting with React's `Suspense` and `lazy`.

## Detailed Transformation Plans
1. Set up `react-router-dom` in the React application.
2. Define routes using `<Route>` and `<Switch>` components.
3. Embrace code splitting with React's `Suspense` and `lazy` for route components.
