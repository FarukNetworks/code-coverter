# Angular to React Migration Strategy

Here's the complete plan and the strategies involved in migrating an Angular application to React.

The migration process involves the following steps:

## 1. Preparation

- Understand the architecture of the Angular application.
- Identify different Angular modules, components, and services used.
- Note down the directives and template syntax used in the application.
- Understand the use case of every service, component, or any part of the application.
- Make a list of all third-party libraries used and their usages.

## 2. Component-Based Development

- Identify the common components in the Application
- Check if we can make them more atomic to be reusable.
- One thing to remember is Angular provides a way to maintain the state of the application in Controllers which is different in React, we can use Redux for state Management or we can leverage useState, useEffect hooks provided by React.

## 3. Conversion & Mapping

### Lifecycle Methods

Angular's lifecycle hooks can be replaced with lifecycle methods in React. Below is a basic mapping:

- `ngOnInit()` can be replaced with `componentDidMount()` or `useEffect(...)`
- `ngOnChanges()` can be replaced with `componentDidUpdate()` or the second argument in `useEffect(...)`
- `ngOnDestroy()` can be replaced with return function in `useEffect(...)` method

### State management

Angular's `ngModel` for two-way data binding is similar to using 'value' and 'onChange' in React, or a combination of 'useState', 'useEffect' a hook for a similar effect.

### Routing

In Angular we have in-built routing module (RouterModule), but in React we have to use third-party libraries like 'react-router-dom'. 

### Dependency Injection

Dependency injection in Angular can be replaced with hooks in React. E.g., `useContext` can be used to replace Angular's providers.

### Service to Hooks Conversion

Service calls in Angular can be replaced with `useEffect` and `fetch` or an external library such as 'axios' for HTTP requests in React.

### Template Syntax

Angular handles logic and conditionals inside the templates, while React handles it in the component itself. So code needs to be migrated accordingly.

## 4. Testing

- React uses Jest for testing, so tests in Angular using Jasmine and Karma need to be migrated to Jest.

## 5. Integration

- Check if all the components are working as expected together.

This is just an overall strategy. The actual migration might need additional steps based on the complexity of the project.
