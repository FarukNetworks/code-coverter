## Migration Strategy from Angular to React

### Step 1: Analyze component lifecycle methods

Angular follows a declarative approach while React is more of a sequential one. Here are some equivalents:

- `ngOnInit` in Angular is equivalent to `componentDidMount` in React.
- `ngOnDestroy` in Angular is equivalent to `componentWillUnmount` in React. 
- `ngOnChanges` in Angular is equivalent to `componentDidUpdate` in React.

### Step 2: State Management

In Angular, we use services and dependency injection for cross component communication, while in react, we will be using the state management. Angular's two-way-data binding has to be converted into a unidirectional data flow in react using State and Props. 

### Step 3: Routing 

Angular uses `RouterModule` from `@angular/router` for routing while in react, we switch to `react-router-dom`. Angular's `<router-outlet>` should be replaced with `Route` and `<routerLink>` should be replaced with `Link` in react.

### Step 4: Services to React hooks 

Typically, Angular services that fetch data from backend would be converted to custom React hooks. This allows for reuse of data fetching logic across components and also keeps our components free of side effects.

### Step 5: Template Syntax Changes

Angular's template syntax and directives (like *ngIf, *ngFor etc.) will need to be converted to JSX syntax. For example, `*ngIf` would turn into a ternary operation or && operation, and `*ngFor` would become `Array.prototype.map`.

### Step 6: Decorators Replacement

Angular heavily uses decorators like @Input(), @Output(), @ViewChild() etc. These should be replaced by state and props in React.

Please note that thorough testing is required after each step of migration to make sure everything is working as expected.
